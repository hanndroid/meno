      <p>
        Welcome to Meno. We're a community of women, men, families and employers
        who've come together to raise awareness about the menopause and create
        an environment of support and empowerment for women. We provide
        education to employers about the menopause so they can understand the
        needs of their female workforce. We provide women with tools,
        information, advice and resources to support their health and wellbeing.
        We provide consultations to GP services so that doctors can support to
        their female patients in better ways. Our goal is to create a society
        which is informed and actively supports the billion women globally who
        are going through menopause right now.

        On this website you'll find a plethora of information and resources
        including podcasts, guidelines, women's stories, and downloadable
        infographics that you can complete, download and take to your doctors.
        We'll also be launching a store that sells products that help menopause
        symptoms - and only the ones that have been scientifically proven to
        help relive symptoms. You can rest assured that our product range will
        be of the highest quality, all with natural, organic, and locally
        sourced ingredients.
